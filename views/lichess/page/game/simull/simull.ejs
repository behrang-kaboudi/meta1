                        [1964] Out of 50 opponents, Fischer won 47 games, drew 2 and lost 1.

                        The concept is taken from real world events. In real life, this involves the simul host moving
                        from table to table to play a single move.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the simul starts, every player starts a game with the host. The simul ends when all games
                        are complete. Simuls are always casual. Rematches, takebacks and adding time are disabled.
